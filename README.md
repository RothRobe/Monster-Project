# Wind Shadow: A Game Inspired by Kemari

## Overview
This is a 2D side-scrolling game inspired by Japanese folklore and the Heian period. In the game, the player navigates a mysterious world, avoiding the **Wind Shadow**, a yokai embodying the unseen fears and isolation of the Heian court. This game blends cultural storytelling with simple mechanics and pixel art aesthetics.

This game was developed as part of a university project for a Japanese literature class about monsters in Japan.
